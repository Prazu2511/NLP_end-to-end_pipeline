# NLP_end-to-end_pipeline
This project implements an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for multi-label classification and domain-specific entity extraction. It also includes a REST API for model interaction. The key steps in the pipeline are dataset creation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and future enhancement plans.
